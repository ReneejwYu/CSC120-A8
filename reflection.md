- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
The class represent an adventurer in a fantasy world where people can fly, shrink, grow...This character can explore, interact with items, and adapt in size and position.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I do not have additional method.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Brainstorming potential classes helps me think about the setting of my code. I also started this assignment as early as possible, which gives me more time to think.
